# What will 10 / 3 evaluate to?

puts 10 / 3     # 3

    # - Division with integers will ignore the decimal part of the result. 
    # - If we want to get a decimal one of the numbers must be a decimal. 
    # - For example, 10 / 3.0 will give 3.33333


# What will 5 + 5 / 2.0 evaluate to?

puts 5 + 5 / 2.0      # 7.5
    # - Arithmetic follows the order of operations. 
    # - Division has a higher precedence than addition.


# What will 27 % 6 evaluate to?

puts 27 % 6
    # - Modulo (%) gives us the remainder of the divis
    # - 27 divided by 6 is 4 w/ remainder 3. So the answer is 3.
